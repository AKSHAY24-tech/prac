The project  HR Analysis Dashboard closely corresponds with the main conclusions and goals mentioned in the literature review about using HR analytics and dashboards for efficient workforce management.

This project highlights the significance of using HR analytics to support strategic business objectives and data-driven decision-making in HR, which is in line with the research conducted by Ragimol et al. (2021). Proactive interventions and strategic personnel planning are made possible by the HR Analysis Dashboard, which offers a centralized platform for combining diverse workforce data and delivering thorough, interactive insights, as noted in the literature.

Similarly,  Monika Arora et al. (2016) study, this initiative makes use of a dashboard to examine HR datasets and convert the findings into recommendations that can be put into practice. The paper's emphasis on using analytics for strategic planning is in line with the dashboard's interactive visualizations, filters, and exploration features, which enable HR professionals and business leaders to make well-informed, data-driven decisions.

The initiative aligns with the conclusions of Raji et al. (2018) by emphasizing the optimization of employment investments, cultivating a high-performing and engaged staff, and gaining a competitive edge through data-driven decision-making. Their research highlights the importance of HR analytics as a tool for talent management and solving HR-related issues, which the HR Analysis Dashboard appears to be well-positioned to handle.

Moreover, the goals of the project, which include improving labor productivity, utilizing predictive analytics, and coordinating HR strategy with business objectives, are consistent with the research conducted by Tilottama Singh et al. (2020) and Giamene Odom et al. (2023). These articles demonstrate the expanding significance of HR analytics and workforce analytics, as well as their implications for strategic alignment and efficient workforce planning.

Lastly, the literature review's description of the project's ability to change HR operations and boost worker performance is consistent with Weena Yancey et al. (2015) findings. Their research highlights how HR analytics can improve labor productivity and income generation—two important goals that the HR Analysis Dashboard initiative appears to be aiming for.

The HR Analysis Dashboard project, as a whole, shows a good alignment with the body of research that has already been done on the use of dashboards and HR analytics for efficient people management. In the process of putting the company in a position to use data-driven insights for competitive advantage and strategic decision-making, this initiative seems to address the opportunities and constraints noted in the literature.
